"""No artifact may reach the global ``.agents`` layer through ``Path.home()``.

The global layer has exactly one resolver: ``global_agents_dir()`` from
``mvgeos_core``, which honours ``$MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR`` and otherwise returns
``~/.agents``. Import it from the package root rather than
``mvgeos_core.constants``: the root is the public surface, and it re-exports
the resolvers whether they live in ``constants`` or in the newer ``layers``
module. Spelling the same directory out as
``Path.home() / ".agents"`` produces a path that looks correct and is not:
under a relocated global dir the two disagree, and the divergence is silent.

The serious direction of that silence is ``approval-rune``. The engine's
installer resolves the purge target through ``global_agents_dir()``
(``mvgeos_runes/installer.py::_approval_dir``), so under
``MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR=/tmp/x``:

- the gate wrote its grants to ``~/.agents/approval/policy.toml``
- ``mvgeos rune uninstall approval-rune`` deleted
  ``/tmp/x/approval/policy.toml``

**The grants the uninstall claims to delete survive.** Security-relevant
state outlives the operation meant to revoke it. The other affected runes
cost hermeticity rather than safety, which is why they stayed invisible
longer.

Why a gate and not a review rule: a handful of greps found these in under a
minute, and a grep is not a gate. This module is wired into the ordinary
``pytest`` run (CI runs bare ``pytest``, per the README), so the next bypass
fails the build instead of being noticed by whoever next relocates the
global dir.

How it decides
--------------
A violation is a **path-join chain** -- an ``a / b / c`` expression -- that
both resolves home and contains the ``.agents`` segment. Home resolution is
followed one hop through simple local names (``base = Path.home()`` then
``base / ".agents"``, or ``base = g if g else Path.home()``), which is the
shape every known bypass actually used. Chaining on the expression rather
than the statement is what keeps ``~/.claude/skills`` and a project-relative
``Path(".agents/skills")`` out of the results when they merely share a list
literal with a legitimate home path.

Two deliberate exclusions:

- ``~/.claude/skills`` (see ``seeker/dci_matcher.py``) is a third-party
  convention, not our layer. ``Path.home()`` is the right answer there, and
  the check leaves it alone because no ``.agents`` segment is joined on.
- Project-relative ``<cwd>/.agents/...`` is a different layer.

Known limitation. Taint follows names bound directly in the same module and
propagates only one hop. A bypass hidden behind a function call
(``def _root(): return Path.home()`` then ``_root() / ".agents"``) is not
seen. That is a deliberate trade: a resolver indirection is exactly how the
correct code is written, so following calls would flag the fixes too.
