"""No Rune may import another Rune's package. Nothing else may either.

This is the boundary the whole marketplace is sold on. A Rune may import
engine packages -- ``mvgeos_core``, ``mvgeos_runes``, ``mvgeos_agent`` -- and
never another Rune. That absolute rule is what makes each Rune independently
installable into ``~/.agents/extensions/`` without dragging a sibling along.
An artifact that imports a sibling does not work when installed on its own,
and the failure is a ``ModuleNotFoundError`` in someone else's session.

The rule extends to test suites, and that extension is the point of this gate.
Before this gate, four test files across two Runes imported a sibling, and
they did it in four different shapes -- see
``test_the_gate_would_catch_a_regression`` for the inventory, which is the
actual content of upstream issue #5. Two of the four failed outright when
their Rune's suite ran standalone. The other two passed, which is worse:

- ``selfmod-bridge/tests/test_chain.py`` put the sibling's root on
  ``sys.path`` for the duration of one import, so it worked standalone by
  construction.
- ``session-search/tests/test_session_search.py`` guarded its sibling import
  with ``pytest.importorskip``, so the day ``session-search`` gained its own
  ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` -- the natural next edit, and what its seven
  siblings already had -- the test did not fail. It *skipped*. Coverage
  vanished and nothing went red.

That second shape is why this gate is static. The four violations were
reachable by four mechanisms: a hard ``import``, a hard ``from ... import``,
``importlib.import_module`` with a scoped ``sys.path`` insert, and
``pytest.importorskip``. A behavioural gate -- run each Rune's suite and fail
if it collects anything the Rune's own ``pythonpath`` cannot resolve -- cannot
see the ``importorskip`` shape at all, because that shape is *designed* to
resolve to a skip. So the behavioural property is asserted where it belongs:
by actually running ``pytest runes/<rune>/tests`` standalone, one Rune at a
time. This gate covers the property a skip cannot hide, and it fails before
anyone runs pytest at all.

Why not widen one of the two existing gates
------------------------------------------
Neither covers this class, and merging them would lose their names:

- ``mvgeos-core/scripts/check_marketplace_contract.py`` is engine-side. It
  asserts a symbol exists and that a package-root import exposes it in
  ``__all__``. That is import *resolution*: does this name work at all. It has
  no view of an import graph, so it cannot see that a test reached sideways
  into a package that resolves perfectly well. An engine-side gate cannot even
  see this repository's tree.
- ``tests/test_global_agents_dir_contract.py`` is marketplace-side and
  AST-based, but its ``_SKIP_DIRS = {"tests", "__pycache__"}`` excludes test
  directories by design -- a test fixture is allowed to construct a fake
  ``.agents`` layout -- and it matches only ``Path.home()`` plus ``.agents``
  join chains. Right gate, different failure class: resolver bypass, not
  sibling reach-across.

The one documented exception
----------------------------
``tests/test_cross_rune_integration.py`` is the only file in the repository
permitted to import a sibling, and it is whitelisted by path in
``CROSS_RUNE_INTEGRATION`` below. It earns that by owning the two facts that
genuinely need two Runes to state: that session-search can index a Pi session
via pi-codec's codec, and that selfmod-bridge and steering-bridge chain
cleanly on one Sigil.

**That constant is the most dangerous line in this file.** Widening it is the
cheapest way to make the gate lie, and it is a one-line edit, so it needs a
guard that does not live in the same place. It has one:
``test_only_the_documented_exception_may_import_a_sibling`` recomputes which
repo-tier files actually reach across, independently of the scan's own skip
logic, and holds the exemption to exactly that set. So widening fails in both
directions -- a new file that reaches across is caught even if the skip was
widened to allow it, and a widening that exempts a file reaching across
nothing is caught as dead config. Do not widen it. If a new test needs two
Runes, make it a case in that one file, where the exception is visible in
review.

How it decides
--------------
Sibling identity comes from ``index.json``, not from directory naming: an
artifact publishes the importable package directories beside its
``manifest.json``, which ``Artifact.top_level_names`` already computes and
``tests/test_index_consistency.py`` already checks against the index. So
publishing a new Rune automatically extends this gate, and a name that no
indexed artifact owns is not a sibling.

Every module in an artifact is scanned, split into the two tiers that carry
different weight:

``runtime``
    Published code. A sibling import here is the product defect.
``tests``
    The Rune's own suite, which must stay installable on its own. Adding a
    sibling to a ``pythonpath`` to make a suite pass is not a workaround, it
    is the erosion: it makes the violation permanent, invisible, and ties the
    suite to a directory the Rune will not have when it is installed alone.

The repository's own ``tests/`` and root ``conftest.py`` form a third tier
scanned against the same rule, with the single exception above.

Known limitations
-----------------
Three, all deliberate:

- A dynamic import whose module name is computed (``import_module(name)``)
  is not seen. Resolving a name would mean running the module.
- ``import rune`` is not a sibling import by this measure. Every artifact ships
  a top-level ``rune.py``, so the name is ambiguous by construction and no
  static check can attribute it. The engine loads ``rune`` from the Rune's own
  directory; that is why ``conftest.py`` and ``marketplace_index.py`` both avoid
  putting every Rune root on ``sys.path`` at once. This gate does not
  attempt it.
- A ``sys.path`` mutation naming a sibling's *directory* is not flagged on its
  own, because reading a sibling's fixture file is legitimate and the shape
  overlaps with the import checks above. The permanent version of the problem
  is covered instead by
  ``test_no_artifact_puts_a_sibling_on_its_own_pythonpath``: a sibling in a
  Rune's declared ``pythonpath`` is a config fact with no innocent reading, and
  it is exactly the edit this gate exists to make impossible to get away with.
