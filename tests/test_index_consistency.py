"""``index.json``, the filesystem, and the pytest config must agree.

``index.json`` is the single source of truth for what this marketplace
publishes and what kind of thing each artifact is. Everything else -- the
``sys.path`` roots in ``conftest.py``, the ``testpaths`` and ``pythonpath``
lists in ``pyproject.toml``, the directories CI runs -- is downstream of it.

TOML and YAML cannot call into Python, so parts of that downstream config has
to restate the index literally. Restating is fine; *drifting* is not. These
tests exist so that drift fails the build instead of being discovered later,
by a user, when an artifact turns out to be uninstallable or untested.

Every check here is deliberately cheap and offline: it reads JSON and TOML and
stats paths. It imports nothing from the artifacts under test.
