"""No Rune may widen the sandbox's privilege set past the forbidden modules.

``MvgeSandbox.execute_code`` accepts an ``allowed_modules`` allowlist. Since
ADR 0015 an entry naming a ``FORBIDDEN_NAMES`` member is refused at the import,
so the allowlist cannot hand back ``os.system`` or ``subprocess.run``.

That closes the capability. It does not stop a Rune from *asking* for it. The
host builds one ``MvgeSandbox`` per session and hands it to every Rune as
``api.sandbox`` through ``RuneLifecycle``, so a Rune that passed
``allowed_modules={"os", "subprocess"}`` would get a refusal at every use --
correct, but discovered one action at a time, on synthesised code nobody
reviewed, with the real cause one layer down from the symptom.

``heal-my-goap`` was the only caller in the marketplace, and its list once
granted command execution outright. A grep found that; a grep is not a gate.
This module is wired into the ordinary ``pytest`` run, so the next Rune to
widen its own privilege set fails the build instead of being noticed by
whoever next reads a security diff.

The forbidden set is imported from ``mvgeos_core.sandbox`` rather than
restated. A local copy is a second list that drifts from the engine's, which
is exactly the failure ADR 0014's index check exists to prevent.

Scope: this asserts the *configuration*, not the runtime. It cannot see a
module reached by some route other than ``allowed_modules``, and it does not
try to. ``FORBIDDEN_NAMES`` is the engine's rule; this is the marketplace's
check that no Rune asks the engine to disagree with itself.
