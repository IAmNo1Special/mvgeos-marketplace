"""OpenCode Zen as a MvgeOS Realm.

Zen is an OpenAI Chat Completions compatible gateway: it serves
``https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/chat/completions`` and advertises its catalog at
``https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`` in the standard ``/v1/models`` shape. So
this Realm speaks the same wire dialect as any other OpenAI-compatible
endpoint, and the only thing that distinguishes it from ``openrouter-realm`` is
its base URL and its bearer credential.

What it does *not* do is inherit OpenRouter's extensions. ``reasoning: {effort}``
is an OpenRouter-specific request field, not part of the Chat Completions
standard, so this Realm never sends it: a wire boundary carries standard fields
only. Contemplation deltas are still *read*, because a gateway is free to relay
whatever an upstream model emits and dropping it would lose the Summoner's
reasoning from the transcript.

Every model on Zen is reachable with an ``opencode/<model-id>`` slug, and the
free tier (``space-bunny-free``, ``big-pickle``, ``nemotron-3-ultra-free`` and
the rest) is reachable with the same key. A free model is a normal model here;
nothing about this Realm is a free-only path.
