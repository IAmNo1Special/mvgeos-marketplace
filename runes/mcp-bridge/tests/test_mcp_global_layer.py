"""The user-scope mcp.json must be found under the relocated global layer.

``get_prioritized_mcp_configs`` honoured a ``global_dir`` *argument* but fell
back to ``Path.home()`` when it was omitted, so the user layer was read from
the real home directory even under ``$MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR``.

There is a second trap here that the obvious one-line fix walks into.
``global_agents_dir()`` already *is* the ``.agents`` layer, so joining
another ``.agents`` onto it would look under ``<layer>/.agents/mcp.json`` and
silently find nothing -- the install path and the discovery path resolving
differently, which is the failure mode the shared resolver exists to
prevent.
