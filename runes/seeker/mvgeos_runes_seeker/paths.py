"""The one place Seeker derives a search root from the ``.agents`` layer.

Four of these roots used to be relative literals spelled out inside the
Rune: ``.agents/.mvgeos/spells``, ``.agents/.mvgeos/skills``,
``.agents/.mvgeos/extensions`` and ``.agents/.mvgeos/runes``. That layer
is dead. ADR-0002 chose it, ADR-0014 superseded it, and no first-party code
in either repository has ever written there -- so every one of those
searches matched nothing on a correctly installed system.

Each resolver here is a thin wrapper over the matching ``mvgeos_core``
resolver, and each is a *call* rather than a module constant. That second
part matters as much as the first: the layer is read when the path is asked
for, so a Rune loaded once at startup still follows a layer relocated by
``$MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR`` afterwards. ``mvgeos_core.layers`` states the reason
in one line -- the install path and the discovery path resolving
differently is what allows a Rune to install successfully and then load
nowhere.

``~/.claude/skills`` is listed by :func:`skill_roots` and is not this
layer. It is a third-party convention, so relocating our own directory
does not relocate it and it is not ours to derive.

``.agents/skills`` *is* this layer -- the project one, the sibling of
``.agents/extensions``. It used to be spelled out here as a relative
constant, ``Path(".agents") / "skills"``, with no project attached, which
bound it to the working directory at the moment of the call: launched
from an unrelated checkout, Seeker searched that checkout's Skills. It is
routed through ``mvgeos_core.project_skills_dir`` and reached only when a
caller *names* a project, on the same terms ADR 0017 sets for Runes --
anchored, never ambient. See ADR 0017.
