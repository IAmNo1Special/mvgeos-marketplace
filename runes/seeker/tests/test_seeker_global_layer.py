"""Seeker must discover skills in the relocated global layer.

``_get_skill_roots`` hardcoded ``~/.agents/skills`` as its first default.
Under ``$MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR`` the user-scope skills move to
``<global>/skills``, so the discovery root and the install root diverged
and a relocated run silently searched the wrong directory.

``~/.claude/skills`` is deliberately left home-relative: it is a third-party
convention rather than our layer, and no amount of relocating our own
directory relocates someone else's.
