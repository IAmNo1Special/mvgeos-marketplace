"""Seeker must search the layers the engine actually writes.

Four search roots were spelled out inside the Rune as relative literals
under ``.agents/.mvgeos/``. That layer is dead: ADR-0002 chose it,
ADR-0014 superseded it, and nothing in either repository has ever written
there. Each of those searches therefore matched nothing on a correctly
installed system -- and matched nothing *silently*, because an empty
result is indistinguishable from a layer the Summoner never installed.

Every fixture here relocates the global layer into ``tmp_path``. Nothing in
this file may read the Summoner's real ``~/.agents``: a search proved
against the real layer proves nothing about a relocated one.

``~/.claude/skills`` is deliberately left home-relative. It is a
third-party convention rather than our layer, and relocating our own
directory does not relocate someone else's.
