"""The project skills root is anchored to a named project, never the cwd.

``paths.PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR`` used to be ``Path(".agents") / "skills"`` -- a
*relative* module constant. ``_skill_root_candidates`` resolved it and
``_get_skill_roots`` tested it with ``is_dir()``, so both bound it to the
process working directory at the moment of the call. Launched from an
unrelated checkout, Seeker searched that checkout's Skills; a Skill is
instructions the Mvge will follow, so that does not return the wrong
answer, it changes what the agent does.

It failed quietly in the other direction too. ``paths.missing()`` filters
the same list, and its docstring says why that matters: a search that
returns nothing because its root does not exist is indistinguishable from
one that found nothing, which is how a dead layer stays invisible for a
release. A root that was never asked for reintroduces exactly that.

ADR 0017 makes ``.agents/skills`` a supported project layer, owned by
``mvgeos_core.project_skills_dir``, reached only when a caller names a
project. These tests hold that line.
