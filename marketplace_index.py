"""Read ``index.json`` as the single source of truth for what we publish.

The marketplace publishes two kinds of artifact:

``runes``
    Extensions. Installed into ``~/.agents/extensions/<name>`` and loaded by
    the engine through ``RuneRunner`` -- a ``rune_factory(api)`` entry point
    plus sigil ``hooks``.

``mvges``
    Agents. Installed into ``~/.agents/agents/<name>`` and resolved *by name*
    (``agent_dir("coding_mvge")``); its spells are discovered by directory
    convention. No sigil hooks, no registry mutation, and the engine never
    reads its ``entry_point``.

Those are genuinely different things, so the split is real. What is *not*
real is a second, hand-maintained copy of that fact. The index already
declares the kind of every artifact; this module is the only place the rest
of the tooling reads it from, and ``tests/test_index_consistency.py`` fails
the build if the index, the filesystem, and the static pytest config ever
disagree.

TOML cannot call into Python, so ``pyproject.toml`` still has to spell out
``testpaths``/``pythonpath`` literally, and a GitHub workflow cannot either, so
a declared ``system_deps`` entry still has to be named in the ``apt-get
install`` line that provisions it. Rather than pretend otherwise, the
consistency test asserts those literal restatements cover every indexed
artifact, so the duplication is checked rather than trusted.
