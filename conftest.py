"""Pin first-party packages to this repository, not to whatever is installed.

The engine puts ``~/.agents/agents`` at the front of ``sys.path`` the moment an
Mvge is constructed (``mvgeos_agent.mvge``), and ``coding_mvge`` builds one at
module scope. The consequence for this suite was severe and entirely silent:
``mvges/coding_mvge/tests`` imported ``coding_mvge``, which resolved to the
copy installed on the developer's machine rather than the tree beside it, so
those tests asserted against a stale snapshot and passed while the source was
broken. Adding ``mvges/coding_mvge`` to the ``pythonpath`` ini is not enough on
its own -- the insert lands at position 0 at runtime and wins.

So this pins resolution explicitly, before collection:

- Put this repository's own package roots at the front of ``sys.path``.
- Evict any already-imported first-party module that resolved outside the
  repository, so the next import re-resolves from the source tree.
- Assert the result, so any future regression fails loudly rather than
  quietly testing the wrong code.

The set of package roots and the set of names to pin are both derived from
``index.json`` via ``marketplace_index``, so publishing a new artifact cannot
leave this file silently behind.

The assertion is the point. A silent wrong-tree import is worse than no test.
