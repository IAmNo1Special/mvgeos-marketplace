# MvgeOS

**An open coding-agent platform. Read it, fork it, self-host it, and run it on
a model you already pay for.**

MvgeOS is an operating system for AI agents, written in Python. A Mvge — the
agent — casts Spells against models served by Realms. Conversations persist as
Tomes. Capabilities extend through Runes.

There is no account to create and no telemetry in the engine. One default model
*is* baked in, and it runs with no credential at all — so your first task needs
no key. To use another provider, bring the key for the Realm you want.

```bash
uvx mvgeos --help
```

Three commands and about thirty seconds gets you from nothing to a running Mvge:

```bash
# 1. the Realm — how MvgeOS reaches a model
uvx mvgeos rune install opencode-realm --confirm-python-deps

# 2. the Mvge — carries the Spells
uvx mvgeos mvge install coding_mvge

# 3. run a task
uvx mvgeos --agent-name coding_mvge "summarise the README in this directory"
```

There is no credential step, because there is nothing to authenticate. The
[Quickstart](quickstart.md) walks through it with real output, and
[Use another Realm](quickstart.md#use-another-realm) covers the case where you
already pay for a provider.

## What it does

A Mvge reads your directory, decides what it needs, casts the Spell, and shows
you what it did. `mvgeos info` prints the resolved runtime so you can see the
Spells and Runes it assembled before you spend anything:

```

The `Model:` line is the model you get with no configuration, and its prefix is
the Realm — `opencode`, which is why step 1 above installs `opencode-realm`.
Swap the Realm and the model comes with it.

- **Coding Mvge.** Nine built-in Spells — `bash`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`,
  `list_files`, `read`, `read_url`, `search_web`, `write` — installed as a
  package, so you can read exactly what your agent can do. Run
  `mvgeos info --agent-name coding_mvge` to see the list yourself.
- **Tomes.** Every conversation is an append-only JSONL file you can read, diff,
  fork, and export. Not a chat log locked in a database.
- **Runes.** Mount MCP servers as Spells, trace with OpenTelemetry, wire in
  Agent Skills, read your `AGENTS.md`, self-modify. Fifteen in the
  [catalog](#rune-catalog).
- **Realm-agnostic.** The engine programs against a Realm abstraction, not one
  vendor's SDK. Your key goes to the provider you chose and nowhere else.
- **Desktop GUI.** NiceGUI + PyWebView, with live Spell tracking and diff review.

| [Quickstart](quickstart.md) | Nothing to a running Mvge — and what five minutes does not promise |
| [Concepts](concepts.md) | What Mvge, Spell, Realm, Tome, Rune, and Sigil mean |

| [FAQ](faq.md) | The questions that come up before anything breaks |
| [Rune catalog](#rune-catalog) | What is available today |

## Honest status

- **Pre-1.0.** The current version is on the
  [Quickstart](quickstart.md#which-version-this-page-describes). The internals are
  held to a high bar — mypy strict, ruff, roughly 2,200 tests. The command
  surface still moves.
- **The default model call can be refused.** Every install and inspect command
  here was verified on a clean machine. The model call was not, and it is not
  MvgeOS's to fix: when the default free tier is at capacity the run ends in

  ```text
  Rate limited by the provider: Realm requested 2209s retry delay (max: 60s). Rate
  limit exceeded. Please try again later..
  ```

  Seven consecutive clean-machine attempts returned exactly that today. Read the
  number it asks for — about 37 minutes — rather than retrying into it. Details
  in [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#rate-limited-by-the-provider).
- **Runes run in-process** via `importlib`. Not sandboxed, not
  process-isolated. Read manifests before installing code you did not write;
  [approval-rune](runes/approval-rune.md) is a fail-closed gate you can put in
  front of mutating casts.
- **No run-level spend cap.** *Mana Budget* is not implemented. Contemplation is
  a per-request reasoning parameter, not a ceiling.

Install any of them with `mvgeos rune install <name>`.

## How a Rune is put together

```text
runes/<name>/
├── manifest.json      # name, version, entry point, Sigils, Spells, commands, deps
├── rune.py            # entry point exposing rune_factory
├── pyproject.toml     # packaging and third-party deps
├── README.md
└── tests/             # runs in marketplace CI
```

Runes are discovered from standard extension directories — the user's, the
project's, or a specific Mvge's — and load through the same path that resolves
their CLI commands, so a command that appears in `mvgeos --help` is a Rune that
would load.
