| `skill-evolution` | `0.3.0` | Persistent experience consolidation and autonomous skill evolution | `runes/skill-evolution` |

Install via MvgeOS CLI:
```bash
mvgeos rune install opencode-realm
```

`opencode-realm` is the one a first run needs: the engine's default model is
`opencode/space-bunny-free`, and the prefix in that slug is the Realm that must
serve it. `openrouter-realm` is a full alternative and needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
— see [Use another Realm](docs/quickstart.md#use-another-realm).

### Runes and mvges are different things

`index.json` has two sections, and the distinction is real rather than
cosmetic:

| | rune | mvge |
|---|---|---|
| installed to | `~/.agents/extensions/<name>` | `~/.agents/agents/<name>` |
| manifest marker | `types` | `spells` |
| loaded by | `RuneRunner` — a `rune_factory(api)` plus sigil `hooks` | resolved *by name*; spells found by directory convention |
| CLI | `mvgeos rune install` | `mvgeos mvge install` |

An mvge never passes through the rune lifecycle and registers no sigils, so it
is not "a rune of the mvge type" — it is an agent package. The sections keep
them apart, and the consistency tests fail if an artifact carries the other
kind's marker key.

`index.json` is the only place that fact is recorded. `conftest.py` derives its
`sys.path` roots and pinned module names from it, so publishing a new artifact
cannot leave the test harness silently behind. `pyproject.toml` has to spell
out `testpaths` and `pythonpath` literally — TOML cannot call into Python — so
`tests/test_index_consistency.py` asserts those lists still cover every indexed
artifact. CI runs bare `pytest` and so uses `testpaths`, making a local run and
a CI run the same set of tests.

Two layout shapes exist and both are supported: `runes/skills-bridge` keeps its
manifest beside the `mvgeos_runes_skills_bridge` package, while
`mvges/coding_mvge` *is* the package with the manifest inside it.
